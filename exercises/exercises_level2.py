# Question 6:
# Write a program that calculates and prints the value according to the given formula:
# Q = Square root of [(2 * C * D)/H]
# Following are the fixed all_evens of C and H:
# C is 50. H is 30.
# D is the variable whose all_evens should be input to your program in a comma-separated sequence.


# Question 7:
# Write a program which takes 2 digits, X,Y as input and generates a 2-dimensional array. 
# The element value in the i-th row and j-th column of the array should be i*j.
# Note: i=0,1.., X-1; j=0,1,¡­Y-1.


# Question 8:
# Write a program that accepts a comma separated sequence of words as input and prints 
# the words in a comma-separated sequence after sorting them alphabetically.


# Question 9:
# Write a program that accepts sequence of lines as input and 
# prints the lines after making all characters in the sentence capitalized.


# Question 10:
# Write a program that accepts a sequence of whitespace separated words as input and 
# prints the words after removing all duplicate words and sorting them alphanumerically.


# Question 11:
# Write a program which accepts a sequence of comma separated 4 digit binary numbers as its input and then check whether 
# they are divisible by 5 or not. The numbers that are divisible by 5 are to be printed in a comma separated sequence.


# Question 12:
# Write a program, which will find all such numbers between 1000 and 3000 (both included) such that each digit of the number is an even number.
# The numbers obtained should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.


# Question 13:
# Write a program that accepts a sentence and calculate the number of letters and digits.


# Question 14:
# Write a program that accepts a sentence and calculate the number of upper case letters and lower case letters.


# Question 15:
# Write a program that computes the value of a+aa+aaa+aaaa with a given digit as the value of a.


# Question 16:
# Use a list comprehension to square each odd number in a list. The list is input by a sequence of comma-separated numbers.


# Question 17:
# Write a program that computes the net amount of a bank account based a transaction log from console input. 
# The transaction log format is shown as following (D being deposit and W, withdrawal):
# D 100
# W 200
# In the above case, the output should be: -100
