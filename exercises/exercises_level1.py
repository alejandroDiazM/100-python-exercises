# Question 1:
# Write a program which will find all such numbers which are divisible by 7 but are not a multiple of 5,
# between 2000 and 3200 (both included).
# The numbers obtained should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.


# Question 2:
# Write a program which can compute the factorial of a given numbers.
# The results should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.


# Question 3:
# With a given integral number n, write a program to generate a dictionary that contains (i, i*i)
# such that is an integral number between 1 and n (both included). and then the program should print the dictionary.


# Question 4:
# Write a program which accepts a sequence of comma-separated numbers from console and generate a list and a tuple which contains every number.


# Question 5:
# Define a class which has at least two methods:
# getString: to get a string from console input
